            The design is built on four principles that became the design's cornerstones. These concepts arose from our team's previous NRL competition. These basic ideas were to integrate the designs of Cibucan 2.0 and Juracan, to build a chassis with interlocking pieces, to improve the bot's balance without adding more wheels, and to build a bot with a longer weapon reach.

            RUMblebots set out to design and build a 12-pound fighting robot, but they were unable to access their customary workspace. They learnt about manufacturing design, weight control, and component protection. The most essential lesson learned was to be ready for any threats such as an attack. The team adapted and achieved their goals. RUMblebots intends to keep developing the 12 pound modular fighting robot, increase the weight of a 15 pound robot to 30 pounds, and create a 500 gram autonomous sumo robot.

          The team finished designing and constructing a workable 12-pound modular combat robot. The chassis plates were comprised of a titanium, nylon x, and aluminum composite. The weapon was successfully produced, however there is still potential for development. The team also worked on the design of a switch and electrical components, which resulted in a weight savings of 1.1 pounds due to electrical improvements. Before the end of the semester, the switch will be modified and the motors tested.

<!--Our Mission Start-->
<section> 
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="display-5 text-center fw-bold"> Our <span class="display-5 text-center green-dark-rumble">Journey</span</h2>
    <p class="lead text-muted" style="text-align:center">The robotics club adventure has been both exciting and informative for its members. The club's primary purpose since its start has been to explore the realm of robotics and to cultivate a passion for science and engineering among its members. The adventure began with foundational robotics workshops in which members studied the principles of electronics, programming, and mechanics. Members of the group began working on more complicated projects as the club evolved, such as developing and building autonomous robots capable of executing difficult tasks. The group took part in a variety of competitions and demonstrations, allowing members to showcase their skills and receive exposure to real-world robotics applications.The club has had various problems along the way, such as limited finances and technical difficulties, but with determination, the members have conquered these obstacles and continued to develop and learn. Overall, the robotics club experience has provided members with an excellent opportunity to learn new skills, interact with like-minded individuals, and pursue their enthusiasm for robots.</p>

    <h2 class="display-5 text-center fw-bold"> Our <span class="display-5 text-center green-dark-rumble">Perception</span</h2>
    <p class="lead text-muted" style="text-align:center">Over time, people's perceptions of robotics clubs have shifted, with more individuals understanding the relevance of robotics in molding the future. Initially, robotics clubs were thought to be specialized groups for people with a special interest in science and engineering. However, as robots become more prevalent in everyday life, more individuals are beginning to recognize the value of robotics clubs in improving technical skills and promoting creativity. Robotics clubs are increasingly regarded as a significant resource for students interested in learning about electronics, programming, and mechanics while also developing problem-solving and collaborative skills.Robotics clubs have evolved from an exclusive organization for tech aficionados to an inclusive society that welcomes everyone with an interest in robotics to join and learn. As a result, robotics clubs have become an essential component of education, encouraging the next generation of innovators and problem solvers.</p>
